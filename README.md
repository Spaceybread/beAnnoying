# beAnnoying
Creates large text files to take over device storage; multiple instances increase the rate of storage consumed; this does not permenantly harm a device, if you want to revert the effects, just delete the created text files 


Put both files in the same folder and execute doombot.py using terminal/console/command prompt 
Instance count refers to how many text files are going to be created when you start the program, I recommend keeping it below 5 on weaker hardware
Once you're done and want to get back your consumed storage, simply delete the text files and you will be back to a clean machine
